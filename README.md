# Week 6: Advanced Array Methods and DOM Manipulation

This week's assignment focuses on **advanced array methods** (`.map`, `.filter`) and **DOM manipulation**. You'll work on two sets of challenges: **array challenges** and **DOM challenges**. Follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.

## 🚀 Assignment Instructions

### 1. **Set Up Your Project**

- Fork this repository.
- Clone your forked version to your computer.
- Create a new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <your-firstname-lastname>
  ```

- All your work should be done in the provided JavaScript files.

⚠️ **Warning**:

- **Do not change or touch the `index.html` file**
- All modifications should be done in `array_challenges.js`, `dom_challenges.js` files only.

---

### 2. **Complete the Array Challenges**

- Open the `array_challenges.js` file.
- Follow the tasks to:
  1. Use `.map` to create and format a new array of movie titles and ratings.
  2. Use `.filter` to find highly-rated movies (rating >= 8.0).
- Log the results of each task in the console.

### 3. **Complete the DOM Challenges**

- Open the `dom_challenges.js` file.
- Follow the tasks to:
  1. Build the `displayArticles` function to dynamically display articles from the `newsData` object based on their category.

### 4. **Submit Your Work**

- Save your progress regularly:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed Week 6 assignment tasks"
  git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
  ```

- Once done, submit your repository link through the student portal.

## STRETCH GOALS

If you finish the main tasks early, consider these stretch goals:

1. Create footer area with DOM
2. Find free and open API with news articles and use that API instead of the provided data.
3. Put the website online using either Netlify or GitHub Pages.

Good luck, and enjoy coding! 🚀
