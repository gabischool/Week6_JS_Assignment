## 🚀 Assignment Instructions

### 1. **Set Up Your Project**

- Fork this repository.
- Clone your forked version to your computer.
- Create a new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <your-firstname-lastname>
  ```

- All your work should be done in the provided JavaScript files.

⚠️ **Warning**:

- **Do not change or touch the `index.html` file.**
- All modifications should be done in the JavaScript files only.

### 2. **Complete the Array Challenges**

- Open the `array_challenges.js` file.
- Follow the tasks to:
  1. Use `.map` to create and format a new array of movie titles and ratings.
  2. Use `.filter` to find highly-rated movies (rating >= 8.0).
  3. Use `.reduce` to calculate the total ratings of available movies (not rented).
- Log the results of each task in the console.

### 3. **Complete the DOM Challenges**

- Open the `dom_challenges.js` file.
- Follow the tasks to:
